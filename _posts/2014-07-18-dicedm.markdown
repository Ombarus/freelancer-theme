description: <p>Physically throwing dice is an important part of TableTop gaming but sometimes it's just cumbersome (I'm looking at you Shadowrun and your 12 dices spellcasting pool !)</p><p>I found the offerings on the Play Store a bit lacking so I made this app to be as lightweight as possible while allowing any kind of random number generation. Something with a clean, simple UI yet with a bunch of features (re-rolls, sums, explosion, dropping dices, presets, etc.)</p><p>It's free and available for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ombarus.dicedmfree">Android</a> & <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dice-dm-plus/id1439157899?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">iOS</a>. Please check it out !</p>
